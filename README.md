# visualise_agreements
A thought experiment in visualising law
# What is this about?
The work here is an experiment in representing legal information, agreements in this case, in a more modern - and effective way. The way lawyers write things has not just changed at all with the digital revolution.  This digital revolution has enabled many many many different ways of communicating information, with a very strong emphasis on:

* enabling easy navigation through content via hyperlinks - and the associated 'delinearising' of content; 

* visualising information; 

* breaking it down into easily understood portions; and 

* making it easy to use for the final user. 

Lawyers have by and large ignored these trends, and have simply transferred the approach to drafting which they used when  drafting in paper.  This is very linear, and doesn't use any of the common tools (not even hyperlinks) available in the digital sphere. This way of representing information is also extremely difficult for an ordinary user to understand. 
# First iteration - let's get this stuff into html
The first task is to move the content from a word based document, into a HTML document.  Significantly, even just this simple step of conversion to html enables us to add much more structural and descriptive details to the content - making it more generally usable.
